                <h4>Aspiring <span>UI/UX Designer</span></h4>
                <p>
                    Motivated and detail-oriented professional with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, offering a unique blend of technical expertise and creative skills. With a strong foundation in software development, programming, and system optimization, Iâ€™m also equipped with a diverse set of tools that enhance my ability to design, develop, and communicate complex ideas effectively.

                    In addition to my technical capabilities, I have proficiency in designing user-friendly and visually engaging content using tools such as Canva and Figma. I have developed an eye for creating compelling graphics, user interfaces, and branding materials. My skills extend to video editing with tools like CapCut and Adobe Premiere Pro, where I produce polished, high-quality video content that aligns with project objectives and audience needs.

                    While my primary focus is not web development, I have a solid understanding of web technologies, including HTML and CSS, which enhances my ability to collaborate with web development teams and contribute to front-end design and structure. My knowledge in these areas allows me to design and style web elements efficiently, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and functional user experience.
