            <p>Fruits and Vegetables Freshness Status Detection is focused on solving the fruit and vegetable problem that the consumer
                and seller face by using CNN technique and You Only Look Once (YOLO) to
                produce most efficient result as possible. This project can massively help in
                developing the system that the general public most require. It tackles any upcoming
